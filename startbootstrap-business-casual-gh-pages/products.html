They have watched me grow into my ambition and mentored me in ways that I would have never expected from an employer. Similar to my experience at NSFP, I have had the opportunity to transition from a new hire to a leadership position. This was my first role of the sort in a professional setting, which has expanded my knowledge about what it looks like to be a leader at a successful female-owned business. I have performed exceptionally in this role, and plan on continuing at Crêpe Café for a long time.</p></div>

Throughout my high school career, I led over 60 peers across three different choirs, one of which recieved third place at a national vocal jazz competition. My dedication to music has allowed me to take advantage of incredible opportunities and perform with grace and confidence. I have sung the National Anthem at many GU basketball games, and I will be doing the same for the Spokane Velocity and Zephyr's professional soccer teams.</p></div>
